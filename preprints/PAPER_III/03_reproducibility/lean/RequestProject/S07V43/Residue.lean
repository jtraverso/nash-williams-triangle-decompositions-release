# V43 §2 — physical activation in the ACTUAL intrinsic quotient, and the child residue

Ambient finite host `H` on `V` (labels `lab`, types `F`), fixed child core `W`.

* `physBasal H lab F X` : `X` has an allowed decomposition in the ORIGINAL host `H`
  (this is the basal predicate of V42 `nativeSetting`); `physBasal_inherit`.
* `childEdges H W = edges (indG H W)` : the edges of the child core `H[W]`.
* `Q = ClassQ H lab F W = (Sym2 V → ℤ) ⧸ Λ(H[W])` (V42), edge weights `wQ e = [1_e]`.

For a `Bank` valid for `physBasal` and `wQ` (any catalog charges `g : C → Q`):

* `physical_activation` : the selection `selJ hs` realises the word exactly; the payload is a
  disjoint union of the selected `Y i`, lies in the child, avoids whatever the bank avoids, has
  intrinsic class EXACTLY `∑ p, ∑ c, z p c • g c` (an equality in `Q`, torsion included); the bank
  and the cover `bank \ payload` are basal (decomposable in `H`); size and degrees are bounded.
* `residue_mem_lattice` : if `R` is in the child, disjoint from the bank, and
  `[1_R] + ∑ z • g = 0` in `Q`, then `1_{R ∪ Y_J} ∈ Λ(H[W])` (intrinsic integer physical lattice of
  the child). Nothing is assumed about decomposability of `R` or of the child.
* `residue_partition` : exact partition `bank ∪ R = cover ⊔ (R ∪ Y_J)` with `cover` basal and
  `1_{bank ∪ R} = 1_cover + 1_{R ∪ Y_J}`.
