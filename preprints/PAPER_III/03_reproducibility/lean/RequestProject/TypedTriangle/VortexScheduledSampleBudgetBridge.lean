/-! The variable-radius schedule may be fixed on the sampled core before
the sample is selected. Its inverse budget is stronger than the later ambient
profile budget because the sampled core has at most the ambient order. -/

/-- A finite family of reference tolerances can be fixed before the sample.
The sampled precision is then chosen below every one of them and below the
precision already budgeted by the variable-radius preparation. -/
