/-! # Theorem 1.3 of Ehard–Glock–Joos (statement and proof)

**Theorem 1.3.** Suppose `δ ∈ (0,1)` and `r ∈ ℕ` with `r ≥ 2`, and let `ε := δ / (50 L² r²)`.
Then there exists `Δ₀` such that for all `Δ ≥ Δ₀` the following holds. Let `H` be an
`r`-uniform hypergraph with `Δ(H) ≤ Δ`, `Δ_c(H) ≤ Δ^{1-δ}` and `e(H) ≤ exp(Δ^{ε²})`. Suppose
that for each `ℓ ∈ [L]` we are given a set `W_ℓ` of clean `ℓ`-tuple weight functions on `E(H)`
of size at most `exp(Δ^{ε²})`, such that `ω(E(H)) ≥ ‖ω‖_k Δ^{k+δ}` for all `ω ∈ W_ℓ` and
`k ∈ [ℓ]`. Then there exists a matching `M` in `H` such that
`ω(M) = (1 ± Δ^{-ε}) ω(E(H)) / Δ^ℓ` for all `ℓ ∈ [L]` and `ω ∈ W_ℓ`.

Formalization choices:
* An `ℓ`-tuple weight function is a function `Finset (Finset V) → ℝ`; only its values on
  `ℓ`-subsets of `H` (i.e. on `H.powersetCard ℓ`) matter, and they must be `≥ 0`.
* `ω(X) = ∑_{S ⊆ X, |S| = ℓ} ω(S)` is `tweight ℓ ω X`, and
  `ω(T) = ∑_{T ⊆ S ⊆ E(H), |S| = ℓ} ω(S)` is `tdeg ℓ ω H T`.
* The family `W_ℓ` is an indexed family `W ℓ : ι ℓ → (Finset (Finset V) → ℝ)` over a finite
  type `ι ℓ` (repetitions are allowed, which only makes the statement more general).
* "clean": `ω(S) = 0` for every `ℓ`-set `S` of edges which is not a matching.
* The condition `ω(E(H)) ≥ ‖ω‖_k Δ^{k+δ}` is written tuple by tuple, and is required only of
  the weight functions for which the conclusion is claimed (this only makes the statement
  more general).
* `ω(M) = (1 ± Δ^{-ε}) ω(E(H))/Δ^ℓ` is written as
  `|ω(M) - ω(E(H))/Δ^ℓ| ≤ Δ^{-ε} ω(E(H))/Δ^ℓ`.
* We assume `L ≥ 1` (for `L = 0` there is nothing to prove).
